    <h1><em>Bad Girlfriends</em></h1>
    <p>
      In Paris from 1900-1940, there was a flourishing queer network of women who helped shape the culture in France and abroad.
      <br><br>They lived mostly openly and created art that reflected their experiences. While many of their outputs may not have been as famous as their contemporaries, when evaluated today, they are important records of a unique subculture.
      <br><br>While not all of these women were bad girlfriends (although some definitely were), the title of the project is based on a quote by Sarah Schulman:
      <br><br><i>“...I’m sure you noticed that the book is dedicated to Thelma Wood, who was, historically, one of the world’s worst girlfriends who ever lived... So the book is dedicated to bad girlfriends.”</i>
